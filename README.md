# UniverseLib.Analyzers

[![](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/UniverseLib.Analyzers)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/UniverseLib.Analyzers)

Analyzers for using [UniverseLib](https://github.com/sinai-dev/UniverseLib) and avoiding common mistakes when making universal Unity mods and tools.

If you are not aiming for "universal" support and you are only writing for a specific game, then this analyzer will be of less importance to you, as the fixes are generally aimed at avoiding mistakes in a universal context.

## VSIX Extension

If you'd rather have the analyzer as a VSIX extension, you can build the solution and open the folder `UniverseLib.Analyzers.Vsix\bin\Debug\net472\`, then open the file `UniverseLib.Analyzers.Vsix.vsix` and install it.
