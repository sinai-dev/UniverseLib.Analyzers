# UniverseLib.Analyzers

Analyzers for using UniverseLib and avoiding common mistakes when making universal Unity mods and tools.

If you are not aiming for "universal" support and you are only writing for a specific game, then this analyzer will be of less importance to you, as the fixes are generally aimed at avoiding mistakes in a universal context.

## NuGet Package

* TODO - will release soon, for now you can build this project and add the VSIX extension to Visual Studio.
